In this research we opted to target the glycotransferase enzyme involved in glycosylation of the wall teichoic acid (WTA).  The enzyme Î²-GlcNAc WTA has been shown 
to give the bacteria a competitive advantage in stressful environments. Once glycosylation occurs the bacteia becomes more agile in surviving antibiotic environments
