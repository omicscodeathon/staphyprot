## Designing a Novel Multi-epitope Vaccine Against Enterotoxin B Superantigen antigen in Staphylococcus aureus

The wall teichoic acids (WTA) are a major constituent of the staphylococcus aureus cell wall envelope.
WTA plays important roles in :

                                 - bacteria physiology

                                 - resistance to antimicrobial molecules
                                 
                                 - host interaction
                                 
                                 - virulence and biofilm formation

They consist of ribitol phosphate repeat units in which ribitol residues is substituted with D-alanine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GLCNAc)
Some data has indicated that S.aureus glycosylation is strongly influenced by environmental conditions and suggest that Beta-GLCNAc has a competitive advantage invivo. [https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-39929-1].

The N-acetylglucosaminly-ribitol linkage of WTA is an immunological determinant in host immune response.The specificty of elicited antibodies is dependant on the alpha or beta-GLCNAc anomers.
In this study we intend to investigate the possibility of targeting the enzyme involved in the glycosylation of the WTA as a potential vaccine candidate. This enzyme beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase is coded for the by tarS gene. 
We intend to determine if the enzyme can be utilized as a multi-epitope vaccine.
