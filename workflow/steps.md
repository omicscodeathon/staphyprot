Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]

## Below is a list of steps we intend to take to meet our set objectives

B-CELLS EPITOPE PREDICTION
The B-cells epitopes in this study were predicted using the BepiPred server v2.0       (BepiPred 2.0 - DTU Health Tech - Bioinformatic Services ). Only epitopes that had a threshold of 0.5 were and had a length of 10 aa were considered for downstream analysis.

HLA I &  II ALLELES
The HLA I & II alleles used in the T cell epitope prediction were those that have been identified by the IEDB to occur more frequently in the global population  (https://help.iedb.org/hc/en-us/ ) accessed on 12  March 2023. 



CTL AND HTL EPITOPE PREDICTION
In this study the CTL epitopes were predicted using the NetCTLpan v1.1 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetCTLpan-1.1 )
